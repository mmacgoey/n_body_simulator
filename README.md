just a physics student trying to make a visual n body simulation of large scale structures

what the code can currently do:
- place stationary particles on a 2D grid at random positions
- use a cic method to allocate mass to a mass density grid
- display the mass density using gnuplot

what the code should be able to do in the future:
- use the mass density to solve the Poisson equation
- go forwards in time, moving the particles with it
- account for the expanding universe
- generate realistic initial conditions
- get meaningful statics out of the simulation
